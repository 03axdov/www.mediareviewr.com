Built with React for the frontend and Python's Django module for the backend. This project taught me a lot, mainly working on large scale projects and gradually implementing features based on initial ideas and concepts. I also learned how to use specific tools that make hosting and setting up a website easier, such as Heroku, AWS and where to buy domains and SSL Certificates. Basically a social media website dedicated towards different forms of entertainment, such as movies. Sort of like IMDB combined with Facebook.

## Functionality:
  - Accounts can be created with emails, and users can then log in and log out of their account.
  - Users can add info, such as a bio, a status, and a profile picture to their account.

  - Posts can be created so long as a user is logged in to an account.
  - Users can specify what type of media, such as movies, that their post concerns.
  - Posts consist of a title, the title of the concerned media, and a body of up to 2000 words.
  - Additionally, posts can have pictures or videos.
  - Posts can be added to groups, and authors can specify what--if any--streaming services the media can be viewed on (if it's not a game or literature).
