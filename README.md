Built with React for the frontend and Python's Django module for the backend. This project taught me a lot, mainly working on large scale projects and gradually implementing features based on initial ideas and concepts. I also learned how to use specific tools that make hosting and setting up a website easier, such as Heroku, AWS and where to buy domains and SSL Certificates.

Basically a social media website dedicated towards different forms of entertainment, such as movies. Sort of like IMDB but with a focus on social aspects, such as displaying your favorite works or what you're currently watching to your friends. Mainly a project for learning how to create a website, however.
