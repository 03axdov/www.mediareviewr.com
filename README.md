Built with React for the frontend and Python's Django module for the backend. This project taught me a lot, mainly working on large scale projects and gradually implementing features based on initial ideas and concepts. I also learned how to use specific tools that make hosting and setting up a website easier, such as Heroku, AWS and where to buy domains and SSL Certificates. Basically a social media website dedicated towards different forms of entertainment, such as movies. Sort of like IMDB combined with Facebook.

## Functionality:
  - Accounts can be created with emails, and users can then log in and log out of their account.

  - Posts can be created so long as a user is logged in to an account.
  - Users can specify what type of media, such as movies, that their post concerns.
  - Posts consist of a title, the title of the concerned media, and a body of up to 2000 words.
  - Additionally, posts can have pictures or videos, and users can see when they were posted.
  - Posts can be added to groups, and authors can specify what--if any--streaming services the media can be viewed on (if it's not a game or literature).

  - Users can add info, such as a bio, a status, and a profile picture to their account.
  - User's points (the popularity of their posts), followers, and how many accounts they follow can be seen.
  - User's are put into ranks based on how many points they possess.
  - Additionally, they can add a banner, to add more personality to their profile, and lists, to display their favorite movies, series etc.
  - Users can follow each other. All accounts that a user is following can be seen on the right side of the webpage.
  - Users can join groups that can then be seen on their profile.
  - An account's posts can be seen on their profile. These can be sorted by popularity or by recency.
  - An account's friends can bee seen on their profile.
