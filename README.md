Built with React for the frontend and Python's Django module for the backend. This project taught me a lot, mainly working on large scale projects and gradually implementing features based on initial ideas and concepts. I also learned how to use specific tools that make hosting and setting up a website easier, such as Heroku, AWS and where to buy domains and SSL Certificates. Basically a social media website dedicated towards different forms of entertainment, such as movies. Sort of like IMDB combined with Facebook.

## Functionality:
  - Accounts can be created with emails, and users can then log in and log out of their account.
